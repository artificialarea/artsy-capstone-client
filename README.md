# Capstone: Artsy
'Artsy' is an application in which sharing art with your friends and followers is easier than ever. Each user has their own profile containing a timeline of everything they have posted, liked, shared and specific collections theyâ€™ve created. They also have their own dashboard feed which shows all of the art posted by the people they follow in chronological order. We want the user to interact with posts by commenting, liking, and sharing!

## 5. Front-end Structure - React Components Map (to do later)
* (Example) __Index.js__ (stateless)
    * __App.js__ (stateful)
        * __LandingPage.js__ (stateful) - gets the _"prop name"_ and the _"callback prop name"_ from the __App.js__
            * __Login.js__ (stateful) -
            * __Register.js__ (stateful) -
        * __Navbar.js__ (stateless) -


<br />

## 6. Back-end Structure - Business Objects (to do later)
* (Example) Users (database table)
    * id (auto-generated)
    * username (email validation)
    * password (at least 8 chars, at least one alpha and a special character validation)


<br />

## 7. API Documentation (to do later)
API Documentation details:


* **`POST`**
  * **`/api/posts`** create new post
  
* **`GET`** 
  * **`/api/posts`** get all posts
  
* **`PUT`**
  * **`/api/posts/:postId`** update post
  
* **`DELETE`**
  * **`/api/posts/:postId`** delete post



<br />

## Development Roadmap (to do later)
This is v1.0 of the app, but future enhancements are expected to include:
* Personalized Avatar image for profile
* Liking a post (and saving it to your profile)
* Re-posting someone else's post
* Pagnination of posts in a feed via an "infinity scroll" mechanic
* Notifications (informing the user when their post has received a comment or they they have a new follower)
* Deletion of images stored in the Cloudinary database thru our server
* More compelling non-signed experience, especially on the landing page

<br />
